# bacteria-life-evolve-sim
This is a work in progress bacteria simulator. When its complete, I hope for it to be a fun and informative genetic algorithm to watch when bored out of your mind.

It is my first C++ project in a long time and wasn't originally intended to be shared at this state, so the code may be a bit shite. But hey, so far it works.
