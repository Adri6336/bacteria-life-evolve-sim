# bacteria-life-evolve-sim
This is a work in progress bacteria simulator. When it's complete, I hope for it to be a fun and informative genetic algorithm to watch when bored out of your mind. Watch as life grows from a single organism and evolves over time, or watch a bacterial apocalypse happen.  

It is my first C++ project in a long time and wasn't originally intended to be shared at this state, so the code may be a bit shite. But hey, so far it works.

# How to compile
If you're using a Linux Distro:

1. Download sfml.py, arial.ttf, and prac.cpp

2. pip3 install rich

3. apt install libsfml-dev

4. python3 sfml.py

5. Press enter to compile when prompted

# How to interact with the simulation:

Open the prac.cpp file and change the constant variables near the top of the file. These will alter some aspects of the sim like
simulation size, max food to be distributed, the time it takes for food to be refilled, or the max number of bacteria allowed.
